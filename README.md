# A Bio-Inspired Algorithmic Approach for Form Finding, Structural Analysis, and Optimization of Large Span Roofs

This repository contains two CSV datasets used in the research article  
**"A Bio-Inspired Algorithmic Approach for Form Finding, Structural Analysis, and Optimization of Large Span Roofs."**

The study explores biologically inspired design strategies aimed at improving the structural performance of wide-span roofs supported by a single central column. Drawing from natural load-bearing systems, we developed a parametric algorithm that generates and evaluates alternative structural configurations based on bionic principles.

Each model was analyzed through simulation to assess structural efficiency and compare deflection behavior with conventional systems. Results showed significant improvements, including:

- **46.7%** and **59.8%** average reduction in deflection compared to baseline models  
- An additional **6.6%** performance gain using a hybrid configuration based on the most effective design traits

## 📁 Files Included

- `Initial.csv` – Contains all initially generated data (22,113 data points)  
- `Hybrid.csv` – Contains the optimized hybrid design dataset (1,562 data points)

These datasets were used for simulation analysis, performance comparison, and final evaluation in the study.
